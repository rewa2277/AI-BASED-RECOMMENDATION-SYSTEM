This project focuses on the design and implementation of a simple recommendation system using Java that suggests products to users based on the preferences of other users with similar interests. The system works on the principle of user-based collaborative filtering, where it analyzes user–product ratings to identify similarities among users and recommends items that the target user has not yet rated but are liked by similar users. The implementation is kept simple so that it can be easily executed in VS Code without the need for complex external libraries, making it suitable for academic demonstrations and beginner-level projects. This project helps in understanding the fundamental concepts behind recommendation engines that are widely used in real-world applications such as e-commerce platforms, online streaming services, and content recommendation systems.
